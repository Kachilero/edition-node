# Pattern Lab Node

The pure wrapper around [Pattern Lab Node Core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node), the default pattern engine, and supporting frontend assets.

## Packaged Components

The Gulp Edition comes with the following components:

* `patternlab-node`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patternlab-node)
* `patternengine-node-mustache`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-node-mustache), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/patternengine-node-mustache)

## Prerequisites

The Pattern Lab Node uses [Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Node version 4 or higher suffices. You can follow the directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on the Node website if you haven't done so already. Installation of Node will include npm.
